## Optimization Techniques Implemented

### 1. Database Optimization

#### Index Strategy
```sql
-- Performance indexes added
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_datetime ON appointments(appointment_datetime);
CREATE INDEX idx_appointments_doctor_date ON appointments(doctor_id, appointment_datetime);
CREATE INDEX idx_queue_status ON queue_entries(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_queue_priority ON queue_entries(priority, arrival_time);
CREATE INDEX idx_doctors_specialization ON doctors(specialization);
CREATE INDEX idx_doctors_status ON doctors(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_patients_name ON patients(name);
```

#### Query Optimization
- Eliminated N+1 query problems
- Implemented proper JOIN strategies
- Added query result caching
- Optimized WHERE clause ordering

### 2. Backend Optimization

#### Caching Implementation
```typescript
// Multi-level caching strategy
L1 Cache (Memory): 5-minute TTL for frequently accessed data
L2 Cache (Redis): 30-minute TTL for less frequent data
Database Cache: Query result caching with smart invalidation
```

#### Connection Pooling
```typescript
// Database connection optimization
Pool Size: 10 connections
Max Idle: 5 connections
Connection Timeout: 30 seconds
Query Timeout: 10 seconds
```

### 3. Frontend Optimization

#### Code Splitting
```typescript
// Lazy loading implementation
const QueueManagement = lazy(() => import('./QueueManagement'));
const AppointmentManagement = lazy(() => import('./AppointmentManagement'));
const DoctorManagement = lazy(() => import('./DoctorManagement'));
```

#### Bundle Optimization
- Tree shaking enabled
- Dead code elimination
- Compression (Gzip/Brotli)
- Asset optimization

#### React Performance
```typescript
// Memoization strategies
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(Component);
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(data), [data]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => handleClick(), [dependency]);
```
